# ISO 6346 (Shipping Container Code) Implementation in TypeScript

> This repository is purely for reference and is illustrative in it is purpose. This repository contains a few ways of implementing this algorithm. 


This project illustrates an implementation of the [ISO 6346](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_6346) in TypeScript. ISO 6346 is an international standard which describes the identification of a shipping container. The standard is maintained by the BIC (International Container Bureau) and covers the serial number, owner, country code, and size of any given shipping container.. It is also an interesting algorithm as it teaches a lot of the basics and nuances of a language through implementation.
